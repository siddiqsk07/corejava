.Explain the differ b/w JDK, JRE, JVM. 
 JDK : 
Java Development Kit is a software development environment that includes JRE and development tools. It's 
used to create Java applications and applets. JDK includes tools like a compiler, debugger, and documentation generator. 
JRE : 
Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools that provides a runtime environment for running other 
software. It's used to run Java applications. JRE contains class libraries, supporting files, and the JVM. 
JVM : 
Java Virtual Machine is the foundation of Java programming language and ensures the program's Java source 
code will be platform-agnostic. It's used to run Java bytecode. JVM is included in both JDK and JRE, and Java programs won't run without it. 

What is a variable in Java?
A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. 
The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution, subject to its data type and access modifiers

What are the two main types of data types in Java?
Java has two categories of data types:
Primitive Data Types: These are predefined, built-in types that store raw values directly in memory (e.g., int, boolean). 
They have fixed sizes and do not have associated methods.
Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types: 
These are user-defined or built-in classes that store references (memory addresses) to objects. Examples include String, Array, Class, and Interface.
 They can have methods associated with them.
